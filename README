To do:

Immediate Goals 
- search by actor
- filter by rating
- filter by release date
- disable the populate database form so that values cannot be tampered with
- don't assume that the films have already been inputted - modify application to accommodate

Future
- Location of the film
    - find out about setting specific constraints such as "home"
- Suggested films based on viewing habits
    - dominace of particular actor or genre then it would suggest films
    - suggested films in a sidebar that you could rent or buy online
- I'm feeling lucky option - will return a random film
- refactor database class - a lot of repitition can probably be reduced

Far future
- look into php templating

Even further
- converting back end to node?
