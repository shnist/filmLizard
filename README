To do:

Immediate Goals 
- search by genre 
- Add actors and actresses to the generic film update

Future
- Location to the film
    - find out about setting specific constraints such as "home"
- Suggested films based on viewing habits
    - dominace of particular actor or genre then it would suggest films
    - suggested films in a sidebar that you could rent or buy online

Far future
- look into php templating

Even further
- converting back end to node?

I'm feeling lucky option - will return a random film
