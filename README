Immediate Goals

- quick search - search by film title and by actor name?
- cross browser testing
    - style updates for internet 9 - 7

- make unstable branch for new features


Future

    - dominace of particular actor or genre then it would suggest films
    - suggested films in a sidebar that you could rent or buy online

- suggest films you may own - looks at most popular actors and genres from your collection
    - each film comes with a public suggested films json file from rotten tomatoes which may be useful
- pagination for search results
- release date both from oldest and newest 
- make sure all database connections are closed after use to free up memory
- be able to update the location of the film
- convert the certificates into english ones
- possibility of trailers

Far future
- look into php templating
- facebook integration

- aria labels for accessibility

Even further
