1) Combine the genre search into the generic film update 
2) Add actors and actresses to the generic film update
3) Location to the film
3) i) find out about setting specific constraints such as "home"
4) Suggested films based on viewing habits
4) i) dominace of particular actor or genre then it would suggest films
