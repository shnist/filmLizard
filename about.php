                <h2> What is Film Lizard? </h2>
                <p>
                    Film Lizard is a film library that enables you to keep a track of your movie collection
                    online.

                    Ever felt like watching a film, but weren't sure what to choose? Fancy watching a
                    film with Tom Hanks in, but unsure which one? With Film Lizard you effortlessly browse
                    through your collection by Genre and Actor. If you're not particularly fussed, why not
                    try the "I'm feeling lucky" option? This will select a random film from your collection.
                </p>
                <h2> Origins </h2>
                <p>
                    My girlfriend and I wanted an easier way of picking a film to watch than manually going
                    through our film collections each time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My collection is also currently split between my parent's house and university. So it's useful
                    to keep a track of where the films are.
